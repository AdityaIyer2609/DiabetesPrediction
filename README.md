# DiabetesPrediction
Diabetes prediction using various classification algorithms. I did this project to experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier to choose the best fit algorithm for the model. I have achieved an accuracy of 77% using Logistic Regression, 80% accuracy using KNeighborsClassifier, 97.7% accuracy using RandomForestClassifier and 98.5% accuracy using DecisionTreeClassifier. Finally I chose DecisionTreeClassifier for predicting the Diabetes with an high accuracy. I got this diabetes dataset from kaggle. The dataset has 2000 rows and 9 columns. There are 9 columns with the following attribute ---> Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age and Outcome. I have used several Data analysis and Data Visualization techniques in this project. This model  diagnoses with 98.5% accuracy.
